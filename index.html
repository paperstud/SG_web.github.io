                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> Steve Galvan (born May 9, 1997) is an American technology entrepreneur and philanthropist.
                         He is known for co-founding and leading Facebook as its chairman and chief executive officer.[3][4]
                    </p>
                    <p><br>Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook 
                        from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum,
                         Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[5] Originally launched to select college campuses, the site
                          expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg 
                          took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net worth is estimated to be $55.0 
                          billion as of November 30, 2018, declining over the last year with Facebook stock as a whole.[6] 
                          In 2007 at age 23 he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2018, he is the only
                           person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 
                           Billionaires list.[7]
                        </p>

                        <p><br> Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people 
                            in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.[2][8][9] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was 
                            ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[10]
